# Inequalities

Since $A < B \iff B > A$, this document only discusses $<$ and $leq$. The other two simply reverse the sides.
Consider the inequality $A \leq B$. The following actions produce equivalent ($\iff$) equations:

- Adding $C$ to both sides. $A + C = B + C$
- Multiplying both sides by a *strictly* positive quantity. $MA \leq MB$
  - Strictly negative quantities reverse the inequality $< \rightarrow >$
- Putting both sides through a *strictly* increasing function (like $x^3$). $f(A) \leq f(B)$
  - Strictly decreasing functions reverse the inequality $< \rightarrow >$

Removing the "strictly" causes these actions to be invalid for strict inequalities </> and non-equivalent ($\implies$) otherwise.
